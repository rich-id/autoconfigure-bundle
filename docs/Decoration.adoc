== Decorate a service

Since the default way of decorating a service is pretty fastidious (adding explicit declaration of the service into your service.yaml), here is an easier way to do the same and even more.

By using the annotation/attribute `Decoration`, you will decorate the targeted service by the actual one. Moreover, the decorated service will be bound to the argument, property or method in the following order:

- To the argument `$innerService` in the Constructor
- To the property `$innerService` if it is public
- To the method `setInnerService` if it is public

Here is an example of a service that decorates another one. The decorated service is available via the public property.

----
use RichId\AutoconfigureBundle\Annotation as Service;

#[Service\Decoration(AnInterface::class)]
class RandomService implements AnInterface
{
    public AnInterface $innerService;

    // ...
}

== Add an EventListener

Adding explicitly the tag to a service especially for something as common as an EventListener can add a lot of meaningless declaration in your services declaration file.

To do so, you can use the `EventListenerInterface` to easily add this tag:

[source, php]
----
use RichId\AutoconfigureBundle\EventListener\EventListenerInterface;

public AnEventListener implements EventListenerInterface
{
    public function __invoke(AnEvent $event): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----


Sometimes, a more fine control on the argument is required especially since the legacy approach was to name the event differently from its class. Enter the `EventListener` annotation where the event, priority, method and other options can be set.


[source, php]
----
use RichId\AutoconfigureBundle\Annotation as Service;

#[
    Service\EventListener(
        'an_event',
        priority=10,
        method='onEvent',
        options=['label' => 'This is a test']
    )
]
public AnEventListener implements EventListenerInterface
{
    public function onEvent(AnEvent $event): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

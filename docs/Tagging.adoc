== Tag a service

If you have a service that requires to manually tag a service since no previous case fits your needs, there is still the `Tag` annotation/attribute.

The following example tags the service, and is the equivalent of `{ name: 'an_event', label: 'This is a test' }`.

[source, php]
----
use RichId\AutoconfigureBundle\Annotation as Service;

#[
    Service\Tag(
        'an_event',
        options=['label' => 'This is a test']
    )
]
public RandomService
{
    // ...
}
